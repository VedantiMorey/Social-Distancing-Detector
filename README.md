# Social-Distancing-Detector
Times are uncertain as COVID-19 is getting on our nerves and testing our patience.
COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period. Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs. 
So it is advisable by the doctors that if we go in public it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from other people and wear a mask.
So this Social Distancing Detector will keep a track of the distance between various people.
